# AI-Town-Economy-Simulator

#Project Overview
A small simulated town where NPCs (farmers, miners, blacksmiths, merchants) trade resources such as wheat, ore, and tools. Prices change with supply and demand, and an AI model predicts future price trends to keep the market stable.

Problem Statement
Real-world economies are complex, and basic game simulations often have static prices. This project explores whether a simple AI predictor (like a regression or neural network) can help NPCs make smarter trade decisions and reduce market volatility.

Proposed Method
Build a town simulation with producers and consumers.

Update prices using supply/demand balance.

Train a small ML model (scikit-learn or PyTorch) on simulation data to predict next-day prices.

Compare results between the baseline (no AI) and the AI-assisted model.

Plot graphs showing price trends and market stability.

Data Sources
Synthetic data generated by the simulator itself (no external datasets).
Logged as CSV files containing prices, inventories, and trades per time step.
